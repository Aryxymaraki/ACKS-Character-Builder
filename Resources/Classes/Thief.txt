//Special Abilities
1: Backstab x2: When a thief attacks an opponent unaware of his presence, he receives a +4 bonus to hit and deals increased damage (by level).
4: Read Languages: A thief of 4th level or higher can read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20.  If he fails, he cannot read that particular writing until he has gained a level.
5: Backstab x3: A 5th level thief's backstab deals triple damage.
9: Backstab x4: A 9th level thief's backstab deals quadruple damage.
10: Read Scrolls: A 10th level or higher thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20.  However, a failed throw means that the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.
13: Backstab x5: A 13th level thief's backstab deals quintuple damage.
